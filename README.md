<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The idea is born while using [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), which is a very helpful classes framewrok that gives us all the CSS classes for sizes, colors, spacings.
However it can be messy if you have a lot of classes to type inside the component. And not to mention when you want a conditional class based on a prop üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

With claxed, heavily inspired by [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), we can keep our DOM a little bit cleaner with the help of some utilities like props interpolation inside the template string.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Installation

```sh
npm install claxed
```

or

```sh
yarn add claxed
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

If you know styled-components this syntax might be already familiar to you. Whatever you type within the template string will be printed in the html `class` attribute of the component. In the following example every row is a CSS class.

```js
const Button = claxed.button`
  px-3
  py-2
`;

const ButtonRed = claxed(Button)`
  ${({ border }) => border && 'border'}
  text-red-500
`;

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
    <ButtonRed border>Click me</ButtonRed>
  </div>
);

// Note: All the falsy values are stripped from the output
```

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Is the order in which I type classes with claxed relevant for their CSS specificity?</summary>
  <p>No. Claxed is only responsible to combine CSS classes and put the result in the html `class` attribute of the component. If you have any specificity problem you should look at how classes are defined in the CSS file</p>
